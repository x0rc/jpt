# Hello World!


This is the place where I will post my notes while doing `Penetration Tester Job Role Path` at `academy.hackthebox.com`. This path covers core security assessment concepts and provides a deep understanding of the specialized tools, attack tactics, and methodology used during penetration testing. Armed with the necessary theoretical background and multiple practical exercises, students will go through all penetration testing stages, from `reconnaissance` and `enumeration` to `documentation` and `reporting`.


## HTB Academy Learning Philosophy
- Learn by doing.
- Learn the "why" behind a vulnerability and how to discover, exploit, remediate, detect, and prevent the flaw.
- Become a well-rounded professionals who can pass this all-encompassing knowledge & mindset on to their current/future clients or employers to assist them in securing their people, technologies and missions from modern cyber threats.


## Ethical and Legal Considerations
-  When working for any company, make sure that you have a copy of the signed scope of work/contract and a formal document listing the scope of testing (URLs, individual IP addresses, CIDR network ranges, wireless SSIDs, facilities for a physical assessment, or lists of email or phone numbers for social engineering engagements), also signed by the client. 
- While performing testing, `stay within the scope of testing`.
- `If in doubt, reach out`
- Do not abuse this trust, `always work ethically and within the bounds of the law`.
- `Document, document, document.` When in doubt, document and overcommunicate.

## What's next?
- Specialization? Be it Active Directory, Web, or Reverse Engineering.
