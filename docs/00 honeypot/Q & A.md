## What type of analysis can be used to predict future probabilities?

`Descriptive`

Descriptive analysis is essential in any data analysis. On the one hand, it describes a data set based on individual characteristics. It helps to detect possible errors in data collection or outliers in the data set.

`Diagnostic`

Diagnostic analysis clarifies conditions' causes, effects, and interactions. Doing so provides insights that are obtained through correlations and interpretation. We must take a backward-looking view, similar to descriptive analysis, with the subtle difference that we try to find reasons for events and developments.

**`Predictive`**

By evaluating historical and current data, predictive analysis creates a predictive model for future probabilities. Based on the results of descriptive and diagnostic analyses, this method of data analysis makes it possible to identify trends, detect deviations from expected values at an early stage, and predict future occurrences as accurately as possible.

`Prescriptive`

Prescriptive analytics aims to narrow down what actions to take to eliminate or prevent a future problem or trigger a specific activity or process.

## What designation do we typically give a report when it is first delivered to a client for a chance to review and comment? (One word)

Deliverable Acceptance

The Scope of Work should clearly define the acceptance of any project deliverables. In penetration test assessments, generally, we deliver a report marked **`DRAFT`** and give the client a chance to review and comment. Once the client has submitted feedback (i.e., management responses, requests for clarification/changes, additional evidence, etc.) either by email or (ideally) during a report review meeting, we can issue them a new version of the report marked `FINAL`. Some audit firms that clients may be beholden to will not accept a penetration test report with a **`DRAFT`** designation. Other companies will not care, but keeping a uniform approach across all customers is best.
