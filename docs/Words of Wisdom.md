## Think about it..

`Asking good questions is a difficult skill to master, but it's necessary for us in our studies and careers`.

`The difficulty is the dimension of your success that you must decide to step into.`

`Every day is a school day. Try to learn at least one new thing every single day.`

`Closely monitor the ever-evolving threat landscape and try to understand/emulate the techniques, tactics, and procedures of adversaries in the wild. This way you can provide your future clients/employers with realistic engagements.`

`**Keep it simple.** Sometimes challenges can be complex, but the answers might be right in front of you. If you have a hunch, follow it before trying something more advanced.`
